# Coffe-Sales-Analysis


This repository contains a **Coffee Sales Dashboard** designed to visualize key sales metrics for a coffee business. The dashboard presents various data views, including total sales over time, sales by country, and top customers, with filters for roast type, package size, and loyalty card status.

## Dashboard Features

- **Total Sales Over Time**: A line graph displaying the trend of coffee sales from 2010 to 2014, broken down by roast type (Espresso, Arabica, Robusta, and Blends).
- **Sales by Country**: A bar chart showing total sales across various countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, and others.
- **Top 5 Customers**: A horizontal bar chart listing the top 5 customers by sales volume.
- **Filter Options**:  
  - **Roast Type**: Filter the data by dark, light, or medium roast coffee.
  - **Size**: Filter by package size (0.25kg, 0.5kg, 1.0kg, 2.5kg).
  - **Loyalty Card**: Filter based on whether customers have a loyalty card or not.
- **Dynamic Period Selection**: The dashboard allows users to select specific time periods for analysis, broken down by months and years.

## Technology and Tools

This dashboard was likely created using:
- **Excel**: Given the layout and interactive filters, this appears to be an Excel or Power BI dashboard.
- **Pivot Tables/Charts**: To aggregate and visualize the data.
- **Slicers/Filters**: For interactive data filtering based on roast type, size, and loyalty card options.
